# This is a Scope Administration File that can be used in conjunction with [Terminology Engine v2](https://tno-terminology-design.github.io/tev2-specifications/docs/category/introduction-overview).
#
# The first section defines meta-data concerning the scope itself, both for technical use and human use.
# It shows where directories and files live that ar part of the scope, and also
# ways in which people can contribute, raise issues, see what's going on, discuss, etc.

scope:
  scopetag: tev2 # identifier that curators have determined for this terminology
  scopedir: https://github.com/tno-terminology-design/tev2-specifications/tree/master/docs  # URL of the scope-directory
  curatedir: terms # directory where all curated files are located. Full URL is `scopedir`/`curatedir`
  glossarydir: glossaries # directory where all glossary files and GDFs are located. Full URL is `scopedir`/`glossarydir`
  defaultvsn: documentation # vsntag that identifies the default terminology. MRG is located at `scopedir`/`glossarydir`/mrg.tev2.latest.yaml
  website: https://tno-terminology-design.github.io/tev2-specifications/docs # base URL for creating links to rendered versions of Curated Texts. It should also serve as the home page of the Tterminology.
  navpath: /terms # Path to the directory where Curated Texts are rendered. What `curatedir` is for Curated Texts is, `navpath` is for the rendered versions of Curated Texts.

# The second section contains a mapping between scopetags that are used within the scope, and the associated scopedirs.
# This enables tools to find the [SAF](@) of these [scopes](@), and from there all other directories, files etc.
# that live within them, e.g. to use/import their data.
#
scopes:  #
- scopetag: essif-lab # definition of (scope) tag(s) that are used within this scope to refer to a specific terminology
  scopedir: https://github.com/essif-lab/framework/tree/master/docs # URL of the scope-directory
- scopetag: essiflab # definition of (scope) tag(s) that are used within this scope to refer to a specific terminology
  scopedir: https://github.com/essif-lab/framework/tree/master/docs # URL of the scope-directory
#
# The third section specifies the versions that are actively maintained by the curators.
# For each version, the set of terms is selected that constitute the terminology.
# See the Glossary Generation Tool (GGT) for details about the syntax and semantics.
