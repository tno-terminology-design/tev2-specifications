# Semantic Unit

## Summary
A **Semantic Unit** is a basic building block of meaning or representation that exists within the 'mind' of a [party](@) (i.e., in its [knowledge](@)).

Examples include ideas, or [concepts](@), [properties](@) of [concepts](@), [relations](@) between [concepts](@), constraints over such [concepts](@) and [relations](@), etc.

In the context of cognitive science, a semantic unit represents a distinct and well-defined element of [terminology](@), such as a [concept](@), a [relation](@), a [property](@), or any other fundamental building block that contributes to the structure and understanding of a specialized domain or subject.

[Parties](@) use [terms](@) to refer to such building blocks, and as such they are relevant to know about in the context of [terminology](@) [curation](@). Also, [terms](@) can be grouped into [terminologies](@).

[Parties](@) may create a [definition](@) for a [semantic unit](@) by associating the criterion with the [term](@) that it uses to determine what is, and what is not, an instance (or example) of the [semantic unit](@).

Within [TEv2](@), [semantic units](@) can be [defined](@) in, and described by [curated texts](@) that belong to a particular [scope](@). They can be clustered to form [terminologies](@), for which [glossaries](@) (both [machine readable](mrg@) and [human readable](hrg@)) can be generated

The [terminology pattern](pattern:terminology@) provides an overview of how this concept fits in with related concepts.

## Purpose
[Semantic units](@) exist because they are somehow relevant for realizing [objectives](@) of the [party](@) that has this [knowledge](@). Since [parties](@) rarely realize their [objectives](@) all by themselves, they will need to find ways to communicate them (their meanings) to other [parties](@) and/or [actors](@) that work for/with them, such that the lot of them have something we might call a 'common understanding'. To realize this 'common understanding', the [owner](@) of (the [knowledge](@) that contains) the [semantic units](@) must actively (consciously) understand and distinguish between each of them, specify names ([terms](@)) that represent them, and create and maintain [curated texts](@), [definitions](@) and perhaps other stuff.

## Criteria
A **Semantic unit** is something that can be thought of as a basic building block of meaning or representation that exists within the 'mind' of a [party](@) (i.e., in its [knowledge](@)). Typically, [parties](@) have (at least) ont [term](@) that they use to refer thereto.
