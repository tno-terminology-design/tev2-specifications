# Use Case

A **use-case** is a [semantic unit](@) that captures a specific situation or example used to illustrate how a [mental model](@) (or other [semantic units](@)) can be used.

They typically appear in the description of [mental models](@), but may also appear in descriptions of other [semantic units](@), e.g., to illustrate how they are used in practice.
