# Header

The **Header (of a [Curated Text](@))** is the part at the beginning of that [curated text](@), that starts with a line that (only) contains the text `---`, and that ends with a second occurrance of such a line. The [header](@) is a set of key-value pairs (interleaved with comments) that contain meta data about the [curated text](@) and/or data that could also have been part of the [body](@), but is so small that it doesn't warrant to have a dedicated section for it.

## Notes

- The header is crucial for categorizing and managing curated texts, enabling efficient retrieval and navigation of relevant information.
- The information within the header ensures consistency and accuracy in the curation process.
