# Regular Expression (Regex)

A **Regular Expression** or **regex** is a sequence of characters that specifies a text pattern that can be searched for within other, larger texts, for the purpose of, e.g., replacing the text pattern with some other text.

Within [TEv2](@), we use the [JavaScript flavor (ECMAScript 2022)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp) as the language to use for regexes.

For details, you may consult the [Mozilla user guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_expressions), but there are many other resources on the Internet as well.
