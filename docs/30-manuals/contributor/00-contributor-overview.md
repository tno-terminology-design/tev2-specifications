Contributors provide inputs that are relevant for the construction, further development and maintenance of a [terminology](@). They participate in discussions and other ways in which a collaborative and common understanding within the [community](@) (e.g. a Work Group, Task Force, Project Team) is fostered. How such contributions are to be provided, and how the collaborative and common understanding is fostered, is up to the [community](@) leadership.

Contributors can also be tasked to check/proofread authored documents to ensure that references to [terms](@) and/or other [semantic units](@) are correct, i.e.: as intended by the [author](@), and understandable by [readers](@).

Finally, contributors may identify any specific needs or mechanisms that help them do the aforementioned tasks, and communicate these needs to their [curators](@), or otherwise contribute to the further development of [TEv2](@) so that such needs and mechanisms may be supported.

The [Manual for Contributors](/docs/30-manuals/contributor) documents how the [TEv2](@) supports this role.

One purpose of the Terminology Engine (v2) is to provide terminological support for people that [author](@) documentation, specifications, whitepapers, articles and the like. This document provides guidance for contributors to make use of that support.
