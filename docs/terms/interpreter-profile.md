# Interpreter Profile

An **Interpreter Profile** is the set of [named capturing groups](@) that are an [interpreter](@) is expected to populate when it is used in the context of a specific [TEv2 tool](@) (such as the [TRRT](@) or [HRGT](@)).

The [specifications of the particular TEv2 tool](/docs/category/toolbox-specs) contain a section called "Interpreter Profile" that specifies this.

:::info Editor's note
We could perhaps add references to appropriate sections of relevant tools, so that readers can see examples of this.
:::

The generic workings of [interpreter profiles](@) is documented in the [TEv2 Text Conversion pattern](/docs/10-overview/tev2-text-conversion).
